# Newsify

1) Application to generate track recommendations from Spotify based that day’s news. Extract terms from news source. Use those terms to get recommended tracks from Spotify (track of the day, alternative (i.e. opposite to terms gathered), etc.)

See: https://developer.spotify.com, https://newsapi.org.

# Notice

This application has been made public including all available secret details inside the `.env` file to allow a seamless deployment experience without the examiner having to create their own private API keys and credentials. Because of this, web-crawlers search Github for private API keys and deactivate them, if this has happened it will cause the software to fail at certain-steps in the process (Newsify, Razortext, Spotify all requires these private keys.)<br/>
